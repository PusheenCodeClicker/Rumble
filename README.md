A feature-packed chat app on Replit that actually works. Not trying to be mean, but a lot of chats on Replit don't work, or barely work. There's a lot of reasons why, but some big ones include: Unreliable Database, Bad Spam Protection, Bad Profanity Filters, etc.

This chat removes this problem. It uses an advanced profanity filter, spam block, and it has a reliable database that is not hosted on Replit.

It also has a cool UI and other cool features such as Group Chats, Private Chats, Emojis, Time Conversion, etc.

On top of that, it's also connected to a social media site meaning you can chat and create posts! What's not to like about this chatting application?
